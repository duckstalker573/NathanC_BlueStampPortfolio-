The project that I chose was the Biometric Attendance System . The different components that I used for this project were the Arduino Uno, a breadboard, a LCD, jumperwires, buttons, resistors, a buzzer, and a LED. My milestone was to learn how the ciruit works and how the Arduino connects to the breadboard. Since I wanted to first grasp the concept of the connections and make sure that all my parts work, my milestone was to have the buttons display messages on my LCD screen. Throug working on this milestone, I went through many challenges with the buttons and the LCD. The LCD was a challenge to connect because each part of the LCd had to go to a specific part or else the LCD would have energy past its threshold making it not work. Connecting the buttons were also a challenge because it needed to be connected to the 5V power source, the GRN source and a pin on the Arduino, so making the four buttons fit compactly on the board was a challenge. Since I aimed to do everything at once with this milestone, I learned to isolate the problem and to do things step by step and to make sure that all steps worked properly before moving on to the next one. My plan to complete this project is to continue that strategy that I learned and to take things step by step instead of plugging everything in at once and hoping that it works. For my next milestone I'll focus first on the fingerprint scanner and getting that to take in data correctly.  


<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)

# Starter Milestone

The starter project that I chose was the Retro Arcade. The different components that I used for this project included multiple buttons, buzzers and display screens that I had to solder onto the board. The chip and the board contained most of the code, so in order for the project to work, everything had to be solder and connected properly. On the technical aspect I learned how to solder and to fix my mistakes through  de-solder using the pump and wick. One of the challenges that I faced in this project was being very accurate and precise with soldering, the reason why is because soldering joints that aren't supposed to be together causes a short within the system and doesn't allow the project to work. Since the gaps between each joint was very small, it required precise soldering and fixing and cleaning up all the gaps was one of the biggest challenges for me. I look forward to improving my soldering in my future projects and to hopefully make less mistakes with it.
